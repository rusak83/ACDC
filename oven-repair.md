## Oven repair Tips
If your element is not heating up and nothing else on the oven, cooktop, or range is working then check the fuse or circuit breaker and test for power. If the power is on and the unit is getting power and you have standard surface burner element, test the surface burner and the burner switch. If you oven temperature doesnâ€™t appear to be correct, make sure the controls are set properly and that the oven selector switch is set right and that the temperature switch is set to the desired temperature. Then test for voltage, there may be a problem with the oven thermostat or oven elements, call AC/DC Appliance Repair. And remember that your working with 220 volts, use extreme caution!
